# quickstack

devstack clones all the projects individually, so the first stacking takes a long time.
This project  intends to  avoid  that dealay for projects that  are  only interested in any one plugin.
for eg,  the Opendaylight requires only the networking-odl. 

Developers of such projects need not want the latest  clone of the projects like  glance.

This project aims to help such  developers/testers.
